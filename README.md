# Eyes

<img src= "oneeye.png" width='300'/>



Eyes is an exercise in which a pair of eyes loaded in the browser screen follows your mouse cursor. 
## How to Run
Make sure to clone Eyes repo so that eyes.html, eyes.css and PNG image are on your local computer. Next, you can drag index.html into your browser and you should see eyes in the middle of the browser screen.
## Future Improvements
I would lke to code a mouse click event. In this function, a click of the mouse would cause the eyes to stop and "stare" at that point of click. I would then set a setInterval function that released the stare from the eyes and allowed them to once again follow the cursor.
